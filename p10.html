          <p>
          This is a part of a project made for an assignment for RMIT University (Bachelor of Digital Media). 
          The brief is to create a story in a form of either comic, animation or interactive media. I choose to create a visual novel that explore the concept of life.

          Before I was working on this project, I have watched SOUL, an inspirational movie about the meaning of life. It keeps me thinking about the message behind the story, that is life isn’t defined by aspiration or goals and you should not too focus on chasing your dream and forget the fact that some other mundane aspects like walking, breathing or talking with others, is also an important parts of the meaning of life. This breaks my definition of life completely as I always thought I should have a goal or passion to be able to be considered as living successfully. </p>
<p>I believe I am not the only one who thinks the same about life. Nowadays, there are many young children as well as adults who have misconceptions or lose their purposes of life. Hence, they easily get lost while trying to find it. Therefore, I’m making this project in order to help them finding the answer they need and break them free from the stress they’re having for being lost.

            In summary, the game is about a young child (player) who is lost in the Garden of Meaning and then guided by the White Angel to find the meaning of life. The child will meet the four guardians, who is Tigris (Guardian of the Tree of Power), Euphrates (Guardian of the Tree of Love and Virtue), Gihon (Guardian of the Tree of Life), and Pishon (Guardian of the Tree of Knowledge) at the four corners of the garden. They will show you their answers about the definition of life. If player’s answer matches their preferences, they will reward them the fruits that can help the player later in life. After meeting all the guardians, the player runs into a serpent who is the Guardian of the Tree of Meaningless and it offers them a forbidden fruit that the White Angel warns the player not to take from the start. If the player chooses not to eat the forbidden fruit, the serpent would force player into a fight and player might be given a chance to eats the blessed fruits obtained by the guardians to be able to defeat the serpent. Depends on the player’s decision, the story would lead to different endings.

          <p>
            The game UI is also based on the style of the game which is pinkish cute. Therefore, I made the UI to have many colors based on the color theme with thick stroke to match with the drawing line of the characters and the backgrounds.
