          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
          This is a part of a project made for an assignment for RMIT University (Bachelor of Digital Media). 
          The brief is to create a response to pain mangament by creating a game or app that can reduce or distract pain. In response to this, I decided to create a game that could help people relax as well as practice concentration. 

          </p>
          <p> Game type: 3D first-person adventure game
<li> Game name: Dreamwalker </li>
<li> Game platform: Playstation VR </li>
<li> Game console: Oculus Rift with EEG headset </li>
<li> Gameplay: It takes place in a surreal dream-like environment where the player would get a chance to explore and interact with the surrounding using their telekinetic superpower. he superpower is generated by their ability to concentrate which is measured by a headset using Electroencephalography (EEG), a technology that can measure brain waves and detect when the brain is focused or not. </li>

        <h1> Process </h1>
        <p> I thought of relating this project with dreams in response to the prompt immersive and presence
          I get his idea when I encounter a proposal from J. Allan Hobson, a scientist from the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard School in which he states that “REM sleep dreaming can be viewed as a virtual reality created from our brain’s devise.” This is because during sleep, the brain is somewhat still active. The prefrontal cortex, the region that handles logic and planning, is less active during REM sleep. Therefore, we frequently don't notice a dream's strangeness or plausibility until we wake up, which is why, until you awaken from that dream, your ability to fly or use a superpower feels so plausible.</p>

<p> Here are my draft concept art. So when you first enter the game, it will show this view on the screen. And as you can see, there are many doors that you can enter. These doors represent different people's dream and when you enter each door, it will lead you to another scene where there'd be objects and mechanism for you to interact. When you use your power, some special effect  will appear on the screen so you can focus on lifting the object more. </p>


       
        <p> </p>
          <p>
            This is the 3D environment design for the game. In the middle is the light portal, the central of the world where you can escape from the dream and comes back to the real world, moons and clouds representing sleep and dream, pastel pink pallete to exert the feeling of calm and relaxed.           </p>

          <p>
            In order to make the game a virtual reality. There'd required some special devices like the MUSE headband a wearable brain-sensing devies that uses EEG to measure brainwave to see if the brain is focused or not. MUSE will be connected with Oculus Rift and it will transfer the data from the brain into the game.           </p>
