          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
          This is a part of a project made for an assignment for RMIT University (Bachelor of Digital Media). 
          The brief is to create an interactive website that could explain an issue happened in digital age. I choose to create the Wheel of Matches. </p>
          <p>
          Wheel of Matches is a simple game, similar to the game “Wheel of Fortune” and simulate Tinder, the dating app. The game starts when the player spins the wheel by clicking the middle icon and the marker will land on the person they match with. The goal of the game depends on the goal of the player, whether they want to find “True Love” or they just want to have fun. If they want to find “True Love” then they will win when they successfully land on the “True Love” ending and if they just want to have fun then they win when they have fun.

          <h1>Theme</h1>
     
          <p>
          Is Tinder really a dating app? People uses Tinder for various reasons: confidence boost, amusement, curiosity, hookup or even traveling. Not much people are actually serious about finding love there. And even if they are, most of them end up meeting people who just be there for fun. How can you find love in an app that is full of catfishes, weirdos, hookups, ghosting, and etc? <br> <br>
What’s your purpose of using Tinder? Are you here for true love? <br> <br>
If you want true love, then the game will show you the harsh reality! Online dating is like a wheel of fortune, you hit the jackpot or keep trying and give up half way, become completely hopeless about romancing online, curse people who are trolling with you, decide to never download this stupid app again and end up finding a decent person in real life. <br> <br>
And if you just want the fun, then this game is all about “fun”. Have some small laugh matching with all types of people on Tinder. Why bother getting serious about relationship here? <br> <br>
This game will simulate your experience on Tinder. It will show the flaws in the app which is not truth to its purpose (for finding love). It criticizes the stereotypical types and people who uses Tinder for their own amusement without considering other people’s feelings. From that, I want people to learn to avoid pranking and think about the other users, especially the ones who genuinely want to find love in this app.

          <h1>Process</h1>


          <p>
            
            <p> The process of making the wheel follows by these steps: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conceptual and Technical Research to have the visual design of the product </li> 
                <li>Design the wheel and UI (the pop-up screen after landing the spin) by Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD. For the pop-up screen which includes the avatar and description of each stereotypes, I decided to make it symbolic (like using Creeper instead of creepy people) to enhance the humour aspect of the game. </li>
                <li>Learn the basics of Javascript (a type of coding language used to create interactive experience). </li>
                <li>Write the code on Bracket: add image, make the wheel rotate after pressing the button, make the window appear after the spin lands, add sound and animation for the pop-up screens. (All these actions were written in Javascript) </li>
            </ul>
